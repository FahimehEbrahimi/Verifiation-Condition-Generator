==============================================
Here is how I compiled and run the project   =
after each time I made changes to the code:  =
                                             =
rm VCG.jar                                   =
make clean                                   =
make jar                                     =
java -jar VCG.jar Tests/test.vcg             =
                                             =
BUT you could do this:                       =
                                             =
make clean                                   =
make                                         =
java -jar VCG.jar Tests/test.vcg             =
